## Overview

Lunar Image Registration is a research-oriented software system for automatically finding correspondences between lunar images acquired under different imaging conditions and registering them into a common coordinate system.

The project is designed around **Chandrayaan-2 optical observations**, including:

- Orbiter High Resolution Camera (OHRC)
- Terrain Mapping Camera-2 (TMC-2)
- Imaging Infrared Spectrometer (IIRS)

and lunar reference imagery such as:

- Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Narrow Angle Camera (LRO NAC)
- SELENE/Kaguya imagery

The system addresses three major challenges in lunar image correspondence:

1. **Illumination variation** caused by changes in solar azimuth and elevation.
2. **Viewpoint variation** caused by different camera positions and orientations.
3. **Scale variation** caused by different spacecraft altitudes and sensor resolutions.

The ultimate objective is to produce accurate, spatially distributed, potentially sub-pixel correspondences together with registered imagery and quantitative evaluation metrics.

## Methodology

### 1. Preprocessing

The input imagery is normalized before feature extraction.

Potential preprocessing operations include:

- Grayscale conversion
- Intensity normalization
- Histogram equalization
- CLAHE
- Gamma correction
- Gradient-based representations
- Noise reduction
- Resolution normalization

The preprocessing stage will be evaluated experimentally to determine which representations provide the most reliable cross-illumination correspondence.

---

### 2. Feature Extraction

The system is designed to support multiple feature extraction approaches.

#### Classical Baselines

- SIFT
- ORB

#### Learned Features

- SuperPoint
- Other learned local feature methods

#### Dense Correspondence

- LoFTR

The classical methods provide reproducible baselines against which learned approaches can be evaluated.

---

### 3. Feature Matching

Detected features are matched between the source and reference images using descriptor-based or learned matching techniques.

The pipeline may employ:

- Nearest-neighbor matching
- Ratio testing
- Mutual/cross-check matching
- Descriptor-distance filtering
- Learned correspondence confidence

---

### 4. Outlier Rejection

Raw correspondences contain incorrect matches.

Robust geometric estimation is therefore applied using methods such as:

- RANSAC
- MAGSAC-style robust estimation
- Reprojection-error filtering

The resulting inlier set is used to estimate the final transformation.

---

### 5. Spatially Distributed Correspondences

A major design requirement is to avoid concentrating all correspondences in a small portion of the image.

The image can therefore be divided into spatial cells:

```text
┌─────┬─────┬─────┬─────┐
│     │  ●  │     │ ●   │
├─────┼─────┼─────┼─────┤
│ ●   │     │ ●   │     │
├─────┼─────┼─────┼─────┤
│     │ ●   │     │ ●   │
└─────┴─────┴─────┴─────┘
```

A controlled number of high-confidence correspondences can be selected from each region.

This improves geometric stability and ensures that the transformation is supported across the image rather than by a single localized feature cluster.

---

### 6. Geometric Registration

Depending on the imaging geometry, the system can estimate:

- Translation
- Similarity transformation
- Affine transformation
- Homography

The source image is then warped into the coordinate system of the reference image.

---

### 7. Sub-pixel Refinement

After coarse correspondence estimation, local optimization can refine feature locations beyond integer-pixel precision.

Conceptually:

```text
Detected point
     │
     ▼
Coarse correspondence
     │
     ▼
Local image patch
     │
     ▼
Optimization
     │
     ▼
Sub-pixel correspondence
```

This stage is important for meeting the desired high-accuracy registration objective.

---

## Evaluation

The system will report quantitative metrics including:

### RMSE

$$
RMSE =
\sqrt{
\frac{1}{N}
\sum_{i=1}^{N}
\left\|p_i-\hat{p}_i\right\|^2
}
$$

### Inlier Count

Number of correspondences satisfying the selected geometric error threshold.

### Inlier Ratio

$$
Inlier\ Ratio =
\frac{N_{inliers}}{N_{matches}}
$$

### Additional Metrics

The benchmark will also track:

- Total keypoints
- Raw matches
- Filtered matches
- Inlier matches
- Reprojection error
- Spatial coverage
- Registration error
- Processing time

### Illumination

```text

Different Sun azimuth
Different shadow conditions
Different surface brightness
```

### Scale

```text
High resolution
      ↕
Medium resolution
      ↕
Low resolution
```

### Viewpoint

```text
Translation
Rotation
Affine deformation
Perspective deformation
```

Each experiment will compare correspondence quality using consistent evaluation metrics.

---

## Expected Output

For every source/reference image pair, the system should produce:

```text
outputs/
├── registered/
│   └── registered_image.tif
│
├── matches/
│   └── correspondences.png
│
└── metrics/
    └── results.json
```

Example result:

```json
{
  "keypoints_source": 1243,
  "keypoints_reference": 1587,
  "raw_matches": 842,
  "inliers": 613,
  "inlier_ratio": 0.728,
  "rmse": 0.84,
  "spatial_coverage": 0.91
}
```

The numerical values above are illustrative output fields, not experimental results.

---

## Data Sources

The problem statement identifies Chandrayaan-2 optical imagery including OHRC, TMC-2 and IIRS, with reference imagery from LRO NAC and SELENE.

Dataset access and availability will be incorporated once the official datasets are provided.

Potential official sources include:

- Chandrayaan-2 / Indian Space Science Data Centre
- LRO NAC
- SELENE/Kaguya

Dataset licensing, access restrictions and metadata requirements will be documented before distributing any data with the repository.

---

## Research Direction

The project is not intended to be merely an implementation of a single existing registration algorithm.

The research direction is to investigate how lunar-specific factors affect image correspondence and develop a robust registration pipeline capable of handling:

$$
\boxed{
Illumination +
Scale +
Viewpoint +
Cross\text{-}modal\ differences
}
$$

while maintaining:

$$
\boxed{
High\ accuracy +
Spatially\ distributed\ correspondences +
Sub\text{-}pixel\ precision
}
$$

The final system will be evaluated against classical and learned correspondence baselines.

---

## Reproducibility

All experiments should be configuration-driven.

Each experiment should record:

```text
Dataset
Sensor
Preprocessing
Feature extractor
Matcher
RANSAC parameters
Transformation model
Refinement method
Metrics
Runtime
```

This allows experiments to be reproduced and compared systematically.
